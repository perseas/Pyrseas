yamltodb -- generate SQL statements to update a Postgres database to
match the schema specified in a YAML file

Synopsys

::

   yamltodb [option...] dbname [spec]

Description
-----------

:program:`yamltodb` is a utility for generating SQL statements to
update a Postgres database so that it will match the schema
specified in an input `YAML <http://yaml.org>`_ formatted
specification file.

For example, given the input file shown under :doc:`dbtoyaml`,
:program:`yamltodb`, when run against a newly-created database,
outputs the following SQL statements::

 CREATE SCHEMA s1;
 ALTER SCHEMA s1 OWNER TO bob;
 GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA s1 TO bob;
 GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA s1 TO alice;
 CREATE TABLE t1 (
     c1 integer NOT NULL,
     c2 smallint,
     c3 boolean DEFAULT false,
     c4 text);
 ALTER TABLE t1 OWNER TO alice;
 CREATE TABLE s1.t2 (
     c21 integer NOT NULL,
     c22 character varying(16));
 ALTER TABLE s1.t2 OWNER TO bob;
 GRANT ALL ON TABLE s1.t2 TO bob;
 GRANT SELECT ON TABLE s1.t2 TO PUBLIC;
 GRANT INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE ON TABLE s1.t2 TO alice WITH GRANT OPTION;
 GRANT INSERT ON TABLE s1.t2 TO carol;
 ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_c2_check CHECK (c2 > 123);
 ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_pkey PRIMARY KEY (c1);
 ALTER TABLE s1.t2 ADD CONSTRAINT t2_pkey PRIMARY KEY (c21);
 ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_c2_fkey FOREIGN KEY (c2) REFERENCES s1.t2 (c21);

Options
-------

:program:`yamltodb` accepts the following command-line arguments (in
addition to the :doc:`cmdargs`):

.. program:: yamltodb

**dbname**

    Specifies the name of the database whose schema is to analyzed.

**spec**

    Specifies the location of the YAML specification.  If this is
    omitted or specified as a single or double dash, the specification
    is read from the program's standard input.  However, if the
    :option:`--multiple-files` option is used, that takes precedence.

.. cmdoption:: -m, --multiple-files

    Specifies that input should be taken from YAML specification files
    present in a two-level (metadata) directory tree.  See `Multiple
    File Output` under :doc:`dbtoyaml` for further details.

.. cmdoption:: -n <schema>
               --schema <schema>

    Compare only a schema matching `schema`.  By default, all schemas
    are compared.  Multiple schemas can be compared by using multiple
    :option:`-n` switches.

.. cmdoption:: -1
               --single-transaction

    Wrap the generated statements in BEGIN/COMMIT. This ensures that
    either all the statements complete successfully, or no changes are
    applied.

.. cmdoption:: -u, --update

    Execute the generated statements against the database mentioned in
    **dbname**.  This implies the :option:`--single-transaction`
    option.

.. cmdoption:: --revert

    Generate SQL in reversion mode, that is, to undo the changes that
    would normally be generated.  For example, if without this option,
    the SQL would be a ``DROP TABLE``, the :option:`--revert` option
    generates a ``CREATE TABLE`` with all the columns, constraints and
    other objects associated with the table being dropped.

    This option is experimental and currently has only been
    implemented for schemas and sequences.

Examples
--------

Given a YAML file named ``moviesdb.yaml``, to generate SQL statements
to update a database called `mymovies`::

  yamltodb mymovies moviesdb.yaml

To generate the statements as above and immediately update `mymovies`::

  yamltodb mymovies moviesdb.yaml | psql mymovies

or::

  yamltodb --update mymovies moviesdb.yaml

To generate the statements directly from the output of
:program:`dbtoyaml` (against a different database), with statements
enclosed in a single transaction, and save the statements in a file
named ``mymovies.sql``::

  dbtoyaml devmovies | yamltodb -1 mymovies -o mymovies.sql
